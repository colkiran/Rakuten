1.Write a Python script to concatenate following dictionaries to create a new one. 

Sample Dictionary :
dic1={1:10, 2:20}
dic2={3:30, 4:40}
dic3={5:50,6:60}
Expected Result : {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}

lloyd = {
  "name": "Lloyd",
  "homework": [90.0,97.0,75.0,92.0],
  "quizzes": [88.0,40.0,94.0],
  "tests": [75.0,90.0]
}
alice = {
  "name": "Alice",
  "homework": [100.0, 92.0, 98.0, 100.0],
  "quizzes": [82.0, 83.0, 91.0],
  "tests": [89.0, 97.0]
}
tyler = {
  "name": "Tyler",
  "homework": [0.0, 87.0, 75.0, 22.0],
  "quizzes": [0.0, 75.0, 78.0],
  "tests": [100.0, 100.0]
}


Create three dictionaries: lloyd, alice, and tyler.

Below your code, create a list called studentsthat contains lloyd, alice, and `tyler.
for each student in your students list, print out that student's data, as follows:

print the student's name
print the student's homework
print the student's quizzes
print the student's tests
Write a code average that takes a list of numbers and displays the average.

write a code that calculates the average that takes one argument, numbers.
Inside that code, call the built-in sum() code with the numbers list as a parameter. Store the result in a variable called total.
Use float() to convert total and store the result in total.

Divide total by the length of the numbers list. Use the built-in len() code to calculate that.
print that result.


Write a code to calculate the average that takes a student dictionary 
(like lloyd, alice, or tyler) as input and displays his/her weighted average.

Define a program to calculate the average that takes one argument called student.
Make a variable homework that stores the average() of student["homework"].
Repeat step 2 for "quizzes" and "tests".

Multiply the 3 averages by their weights and return the sum of those three. 
Homework is 10%, quizzes are 30% and tests are 60%.
