Packages and Modules
--------------------

Modules  - Libraries in other technologies

any python file can be considered as a module, there is no specific extension for modules



Packages
--------
all modules that work for a particular task will be stored in a folder 

the folder that holds the modules is called as a package


import module
-------------

* module will be converted from .py to .pyc file that is compiled copy of the file and then consumed

* all modules should be stored in lib path is set to (Evn Variable)

* python checks for .pth file in python root path, if the file exists then import the path into library path

* python compares the date and time of creation of .py and .pyc file. python always expects the .pyc file to have the latest date and time


add a file in python root directory with any name and extension should be .pth

import module
import package.module

from module import function or class
from package import a module
from package import *
